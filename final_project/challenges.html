    <p>Let's begin with challenges. These are self-imposed restrictions or community-created goals that add a new layer of difficulty. Imagine tackling a game with only bombs as weapons, or restricting yourself to just two buttons for the entire playthrough! Speedruns, on the other hand, are all about speed. Players race to complete the game, or a specific section, in the record-breaking time. Mastering game mechanics, meticulous planning, and even exploiting glitches and shortcuts are all part of the strategy. Both challenges and speedruns can incorporate randomizers. These are essentially game mods where item placement is shuffled, often in The Legend of Zelda series. While randomizers add a layer of excitement to speedruns, they also carry the risk of softlocking or hardlocking the game. A softlock occurs when completing the game requires exploiting glitches or bugs, while a hardlock completely renders the game unwinnable.</p>

    <p>Let's delve into the exciting world of Zelda challenges! First up is the Zero Deaths Challenge, a true test of skill. Here, if Link meets his demise, it's back to the drawing board with a brand new save file. Next, we have the Shieldless Challenge, where dodging and parrying become paramount as you navigate Hyrule without the safety net of a shield. Feeling financially ambitious? The Fat Stacks Challenge tasks you with amassing the most Rupees possible throughout your adventure. For the pacifist at heart, the Pacifist Run demands completing the game without harming a single enemy. And if blades aren't your thing, there's always the Swordless Challenge. These are just a taste of the many challenges available, limited only by your imagination! So unleash your creativity, craft your own unique challenge, and most importantly, have a blast exploring Hyrule in a whole new way. </p>
    <hr><strong>Speedruns:</strong></h4>
    <p>Speedruns are a different beast altogether. Here, the goal is crystal clear: conquer the game in the fastest time possible. It's almost like a competitive sport, fostering a vibrant sub-community within the gaming world. To be officially recognized by the community, speedruns must follow a strict set of rules and be submitted properly. Different categories exist within speedrunning, with "Any%" being the most straightforward: complete the game as quickly as possible, by any means necessary. On the other end of the spectrum, "100%" requires collecting every item and completing every quest before crossing the finish line. There's also "No Glitches Any%" for those who prefer a glitch-free experience, and "100% No Glitches" for the ultimate completionist challenge. But the fun doesn't stop there! We can even delve into "Challenge Speedruns," where categories like "Swordless Any% No Glitches" combine different elements to create truly unique challenges. The world of Zelda speedrunning boasts a vast network of categories and subcategories, offering endless possibilities for those seeking to push their skills to the limit. </p>
