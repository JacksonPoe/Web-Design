    <h3>introduction to the games</h3>
    <p>New to The Legend of Zelda series? Here are some recommendations to get you started! If you want to go in a chronological order, you would play Skyward Sword then Minish Cap then Four Swords and then Ocarina of Time. After that the timeline splits off into three so you can find your own games from there. However, you do not have to play chronologically for the games to make sense. I started with Ocarina of Time then went to Twilight Princess. I would always recommend people to play Ocarina of Time if you can't stand older graphics then play Twilight Princess or Skyward Swords, those are my personal recommendations.</p>

    <p>the first game is simple enough The very first Legend of Zelda game puts you in the shoes of Link, a hero tasked with saving the princess, Zelda. The evil Ganon has kidnapped her and hidden her somewhere in the vast fantasy world of Hyrule. To triumph, Link must explore a sprawling overworld, traverse treacherous dungeons, and collect special fragments of a powerful artifact called the Triforce. This artifact is said to grant the wishes of its holder, and Link needs its strength to defeat Ganon and save Zelda.</p>
