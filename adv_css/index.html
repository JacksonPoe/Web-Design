    <h3>Rooms</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the Azure Reef Hotel! We're thrilled to have you here and can't wait to share our island paradise with you. But before you explore the pristine beaches and vibrant coral reefs, let us tell you a little bit about ourselves. The Azure Reef story began in 2005 with the vision of Angelica Skylar. Angelica, a passionate traveler with a deep love for the ocean, dreamed of creating a sanctuary where guests could experience the beauty and serenity of the tropics. With meticulous attention to detail and a dedication to providing exceptional service, Angelica transformed her dream into reality. Over the years, the Azure Reef Hotel has become more than just a place to stay; it's a haven for relaxation, adventure, and creating unforgettable memories. We remain committed to Angelica's original vision, ensuring each guest feels welcome, pampered, and truly immersed in the magic of our island escape.</p>
